            <p>During this time, the material that made up the shells and bones of organisms living in this shallow sea floated to the bottom of the sea when they died, compacting and creating the limestone that we find in the area.</p><hr />
            <p>As the rocks weathered from hydrological processes like the formation and flow of Hogtown Creek, the fossils retained a slightly higher hardness than the surrounding carbonate material. As a result, Gainesville sediments and rocks contain well-preserved shark teeth, whale bones, stingray barbs, bivalve shells, and a plethora of other examples!</p>

          <p>In the time when the carbonate platform was forming and sea levels were higher, there was a strong current that spanned across the northern part of Florida pointed eastward called the Gulf Trough (figure 1). This strong current pushed the sediments weathering off the uplifting Appalachian Mountains towards the Atlantic Ocean instead of overlying the newly forming limestone.</p>
          <p>Eventually after the Eocene, during the Miocene Epoch, the Gulf Trough filled in (figure 2), and the sediments from the Appalachians were able to make their way to the Florida platform. This led to the injection of silica-rich sediments like sand and clay, called siliciclastics, into Florida. For Gainesville, the most important group of these sediments is called the Hawthorn Group, which is found in much of east Gainesville and plays an important role in the landscape of the Floridan Aquifer system.</p>
